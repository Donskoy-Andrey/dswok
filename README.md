# DSWoK (Data Science Well of Knowledge)
This is a c collection of my notes on Data Science using Obsidian. 

These notes are [hosted](https://dswok.com/) using Obsidian Publish and can be accessed from any device easily.

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a great tool for creating a personal knowledge base. It uses markdown files and allows you to link between them, creating a network of notes. This way, the notes can be easily exported to other apps if necessary.

It is possible to read and edit the notes in any markdown editor, but Obsidian provides a nice interface for navigating the notes and visualizing the connections between them.

The idea of this project is to collect all the notes I have on Data Science and Machine Learning in one place in a structured and inter-connected form.

This obsidian vault will have notes about general ML theory, the approaches to specific business cases, interview preparations and other things.
