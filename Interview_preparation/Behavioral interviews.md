Behavioral interview is a stage of the job [[Interview preparation|interview]] process in which candidates are asked to describe specific situations from their past experiences to demonstrate their skills, abilities, and character traits.
## Key suggestions:
- Focus on real-life examples from experience. You can focus on different aspects of these experiences, but don't lie
- Use the STAR method (Situation (context), Task (your responsibility), Action (what you did), Result (outcomes and learnings)) for structuring responses
- Prepare the answers to the common questions beforehand
- Align your answers with the values/mission of the company
- Align your answers with the expected position: IC - how you delivered the project end-to-end by yourself; techlead - how you organized technical part of the project and helped the team deliver it; manager - how you organized communications and handled requirements and limitations; any level higher than senior - how you handled cross-team communications, how you managed and created processes.

This interview often includes a short intro about yourself, but other stages may include it, so it is worth preparing it as well:
* Most relevant/important job experience and specific projects, including the technologies used
* What are you interested in (production vs. R&D, classical ML vs. Deep Learning, technical side vs. business side, etc)
